### Hello there 🙌🏻✨
<hr />
Hey, I'm Jonathan (They/Them)! I've always loved building things with my hands and my imagination, so what a better way to do that than as a Web Developer! 

  • I've had years of experience with various areas of design and functionality, from AutoCAD to Woodworking to Music to React.
  • Currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, Python, and getting into C++
  • I'm all about building amazing things with and for people to help them feel supported, empowered, and successful.
